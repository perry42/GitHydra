# ROADMAP — post-v1

**Status:** v1, V1.1, the design-pass/Floaters backlog, and **V2** (all five online-sync phases
plus Reset to here) are fully shipped. Nothing is queued as the next milestone.

**Convention:** this file is intake, not spec detail. Shipped items get one line — outcome + spec
reference; the full problem/acceptance-criteria/FR/review history lives in `specs/*.md` and git
log. Only genuinely open items keep their context, since that's what someone needs to act on them.

## Open

### Ref-chip gutter with 2+ chips on one row (queued, user asked to hold off)

A commit with two branch chips renders both labels as illegible fragments once squeezed into the
100px `REF_GUTTER_WIDTH`. Not data loss — every chip carries a full `title` — just legibility.
Options left open for a future design pass: prioritize the checked-out chip's space, stack chips
vertically, or collapse extras behind a "+N" affix. Given this area's regression history
(`App.branchTagGutter.e2e.test.tsx`, `layoutBudget.test.ts`), whichever direction is chosen should
go through real-Electron-screenshot verification, not a code-only guess.

### No interlock between identity-profile apply/remove and an in-flight fetch/pull/push/clone

Found 2026-09-18 by the whole-milestone online-sync audit. A user can switch/remove a profile in
`IdentityProfilesDialog` while a network op on the same repo is mid-flight. Not a data-integrity or
privilege issue (git reads config once per invocation; config writes are lock-protected), but which
SSH key/committer identity the in-flight op used can end up inconsistent with what the UI shows as
"current". Judged a product/UX decision, not a vulnerability — needs product-manager's call (likely:
disable apply/remove while a network op targets the open repo, mirroring the existing "operation
already in progress" gating) before building.

### Smaller open threads

- **Code signing.** SignPath Foundation application for a free Windows cert submitted 2026-09-07,
  still pending. macOS has no free option, not pursued. Until resolved: ship unsigned, workaround
  documented in release notes. (No auto-update mechanism — explicit non-goal.)
- **Donate/support link** — approved in principle, not built, no urgency. Keep it a passive link,
  not a nag.
- **Repo-open cancel gap** — canceling a tab reactivation triggered by *closing* another tab has no
  well-defined "restore to" target; un-special-cased pending a product decision.
- **FR-245 resume-reader API** — finished and tested, but still not swapped in over the shipped
  fast-forward fix. That swap remains a separate future decision.
- **Stash visualization polish** — no concrete gap identified yet, not actionable.
- **Keyboard shortcuts reference screen wants its own design/UX pass.** Requested by the user
  2026-09-20; no specific gap named yet, so scope it before building rather than guessing. One
  concrete finding already in hand, from the toolbar action-row redesign: the screen has a
  `commands.ts` entry (`openKeyboardShortcuts`) and the `Ctrl/Cmd+/` keybinding, but **no toolbar
  affordance at all** — it is only reachable if you already know it exists. The toolbar redesign's
  `⋯` menu gives it one, which closes the discoverability half; the screen's own layout and content
  are untouched by that and are what this entry is really about.

## Backlog — later ideas, not actively queued

Deprioritized by the user (2026-09-14); revisit only when explicitly picked back up.

- **Compare-commits' context-menu label doesn't name the two commits or their direction** — small,
  copy-only fast-follow to match the drag-menu's naming convention.
- **Remember last search/filter per repo.** An earlier draft spec (FR-197–207) was never saved; the
  user wants to redefine the shape before it's picked back up — don't reuse the old draft.
- **Auto-stash**, opt-in, default off. Only build if product-manager thinks it's needed.
- **Per-author identity marks** (commit-node avatars + right-panel chips). **Locally generated
  only** — deterministic initials/color-hash from author name+email, never a Gravatar/GitHub-avatar
  network fetch (hard product principle). Needs its own spec first.

## Standing constraints — apply to all future work

- **Online-sync scope boundaries:** force-push and delete-remote-branch are explicit non-goals, not
  deferred items. No credential storage, prompting, or management inside GitHydra ever — auth is
  delegated entirely to system git's credential helper and SSH agent. No remote add/edit/remove UI.
  PR/issue/host-API features stay V3. Anything touching `~/.ssh/config`, SSH agent key management,
  or our own token store is deferred indefinitely — it can break the user's git setup outside
  GitHydra and duplicates what credential managers already do.
- **Security review is required** for any work touching credentials or the network. The checklist
  is `specs/online-sync-security-flags.md`.
- **Credential redaction is structural**, living in `GitCommandError`/`GitCommandTimeoutError`/
  `OperationCancelledError`'s own constructors and covering `.message`/`.args`/`.stderr` uniformly.
  Don't reintroduce per-call-site redaction — that pattern already shipped one Critical leak.
- **`clone()` pins `-c core.sshCommand=ssh`** because its `cwd` is the destination's parent, which
  can sit inside an unrelated repo whose local config git would otherwise apply (a real RCE path).
  `fetchRemote()`/`push()` don't need it — their `cwd` is always the already-open target repo.
- **`git reset` rejects `--end-of-options`**, and a `--` separator is actively wrong there (git
  parses what follows as a pathspec) — hex-only `targetSha` validation is the compensating control.
  `blame.ts` has the same deviation documented.
- **Never put the user's real personal email in anything public-facing** (commit authorship,
  `package.json`) — use the GitHub no-reply address.

## Shipped

**V2 — online sync (2026-09-17 → 2026-09-20).** Five phased specs, built in dependency/risk order,
each security-reviewed before merge; clone additionally went through three follow-up review rounds
(whole-milestone cross-phase audit, symlink/TOCTOU verification, `/code-review`). All findings were
fixed — details in git log and the specs.

- Fetch + diverged indicator + credential-failure UX — `specs/online-sync-fetch.md` (FR-320–328)
- Git Identity & SSH Key Profiles — `specs/git-identity-profiles.md` (FR-329–337, +FR-378/379)
- Pull — `specs/online-sync-pull.md` (FR-338–343)
- Push — `specs/online-sync-push.md` (FR-344–350)
- Clone — `specs/online-sync-clone.md` (FR-351–358)
- Reset to here — `specs/reset-to-here.md` (FR-359–377)

**Earlier milestones.**

- 2026-09-20 code-review cleanup — clone destination edge cases, shared `useDialogChrome` hook
  across 7 components, flaky tests, root `npm test` exit-code trap, and the
  `refreshWorkingDirStatus`/`refreshRefs` unhandled-rejection bug class.
- Drag one commit node onto another for a contextual action menu — `specs/drag-commit-menu.md`
  (FR-295–319), plus cursor-following drag ghost and real-ref-name resolution.
- Landing page premium design pass + SEO fundamentals on `gh-pages` ("transit / rail wayfinding"
  system, real screenshots, self-hosted fonts, title/meta/OG/JSON-LD/sitemap).
- Release pipeline — tag-triggered `release.yml` matrix-builds win/mac/linux installers to a
  GitHub Release. `v0.1.0` was the first real one; `v0.3.0` is the current release.
- Image diff preview — `specs/image-diff-preview.md`.
- V1.1, all items — `specs/repo-list.md`, `specs/remember-last-selected-file.md`,
  `specs/restore-tabs-on-relaunch.md`, `specs/amend-last-commit.md`, `specs/compare-commits.md`.
- Keyboard shortcuts / Command Palette + reference overlay —
  `specs/keyboard-shortcuts-command-palette.md`, `specs/keyboard-shortcuts-reference.md`. Landed
  `CLAUDE.md`'s convention that new user-facing actions must get a `commands.ts` entry.
- Find Commits overlay — `specs/find-commits-overlay.md`; replaced the permanently-mounted
  `FilterBar`. `Ctrl/Cmd+F` separately focuses the Branches sidebar search.
- Design passes 1 & 2 (`DESIGN.md` has the rationale) — selection halo, persistent left Branches
  sidebar with search-to-jump, persistent leading ref-chip gutter column.
- Repo-open spinner feedback — `specs/repo-open-feedback.md`, `specs/repo-open-feedback-fixes.md`.
- Instant revisit for already-loaded tabs — `specs/instant-tab-revisit.md`.
- Licensing: GPL-3.0-or-later across root `LICENSE`, all `package.json`s, and SPDX headers on every
  source file. No dependency blockers; `README.md`'s non-affiliation disclaimer is in place.
- Priority 0 bug: selection ring on the wrong commit after scrolling — root cause and
  do-not-reintroduce note now live in `CLAUDE.md`'s Known Pitfalls.
- Tech debt, all resolved — consolidated working-directory-status git spawns (`useRepositoryGraph`
  is the single fetch owner); test-suite flakiness under full parallel load;
  `resolveGitExecutablePath()` eager warm-up; repo-open tab dedup case-insensitivity
  (mapped-network-drive-vs-UNC left a documented non-goal); `ipcTransport.spec.ts`'s ambiguous
  button selector.
